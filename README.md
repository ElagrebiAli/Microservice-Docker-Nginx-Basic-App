### Note :
 Microservices : take a complex monolithic application and turn it into a set of services, which are faster to develop, and much easier to understand and maintain.
 Each service focuses on a single purpose and has a high cohesion of related behaviors and data.
 When an application grows and the team of developers grows with it, a microservices architecture style proves to be 
 more efficient over the monolithic style.
 
 Docker : an excellent tool for managing microservices. Each microservice can be further broken down into processes running in separate Docker containers,
 which can be specified with Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configuration files
 
 Nginx: receives all your requests and forwards them to the right backend.is the element that coordinates and orchestrates how all the requests are 
 processed in a microservices architect
